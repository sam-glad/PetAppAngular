<p>The plan for this site is to be a PetFinder clone with a number of added
  features, including (hopefully customizable) application forms which users
  will be able to submit, prompting email alerts for organization admins who
  will then set applications as either pending approval, approved, or denied,
  with the option of adding commentary explaining their reasoning.</p>
