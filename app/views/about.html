<p>The plan for this site is sync with PetFinder's data and allow users to create
  custom application forms from scratch (this already works) which other users
  will be able to use to apply to foster/adopt pets. Upon submission, 
  rescue/shelter admins will be notified and can then set applications as either
  pending approval, approved, or denied.</p>
